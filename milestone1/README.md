You can run and test our milestone by going to the link in our main repo README.md that goes to our Github Pages site. From there, you add the budget block and add the corresponding 
income, expense, and savings blocks and add the integer block to the end of each of those. You can put whatever positive value you want for those three, when you click generate code,
the equation used for calculating the budget in our javascript file will appear on the left and the corresponding value should appear on the right when you run the code. When you click 
the save code button, a js with the code will be downloaded


#Setting Up:
Place custom_blocks.js, index.html, and styles.css in the same directory.
Open index.html in a web browser to see the Blockly interface.
#Using the App:
Drag Blocks: From the toolbox to the workspace.
Set Values: Click input fields in blocks like "Income Source" to input numbers.
Connect Blocks: Attach blocks like "Income Source" or "Expense" to inputs of the "Budget" block.
Generate & Run JS: Click "Generate JavaScript" to convert blocks to code, then "Run JavaScript" to see output.
Save & Load: Use "Save JavaScript" and "Save Blocks" to download code or block configurations. "Load Blocks" lets you upload a saved .xml block configuration.
#Testing:
Valid Configurations: Combine "Income Source", "Expense", and "Savings" with "Budget" to check budget calculations.
