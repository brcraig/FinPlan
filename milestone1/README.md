You can run and test our milestone by going to the link in our main repo README.md that goes to our Github Pages site. From there, you add the budget block and add the corresponding 
income, expense, and savings blocks and add the integer block to the end of each of those. You can put whatever positive value you want for those three, when you click generate code,
the equation used for calculating the budget in our javascript file will appear on the left and the corresponding value should appear on the right when you run the code. When you click 
the save code button, a js with the code will be downloaded


## Setting Up:
1. Ensure `custom_blocks.js`, `index.html`, and `styles.css` are in the same directory.
2. Launch `index.html` in a web browser to initialize the Blockly interface.

## Using the App:
- **Drag Blocks**: Move blocks from the toolbox to the workspace.
- **Set Values**: Tap input fields on blocks, e.g., "Income Source", to input values.
- **Connect Blocks**: Link blocks such as "Income Source" or "Expense" to "Budget" block inputs.
- **Generate & Run JS**:
  - Click "Generate JavaScript" to transform blocks into code.
  - Press "Run JavaScript" to execute and see results.
- **Save & Load**:
  - Use "Save JavaScript" and "Save Blocks" for code/block configurations.
  - "Load Blocks" lets you restore a saved `.xml` block layout.

## Testing:
- **Valid Configurations**: Test by combining "Income Source", "Expense", and "Savings" with "Budget".
