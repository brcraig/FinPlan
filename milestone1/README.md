You can run and test our milestone by going to the link in our main repo README.md that goes to our Github Pages site. From there, you add the budget block and add the corresponding 
income, expense, and savings blocks and add the integer block to the end of each of those. You can put whatever positive value you want for those three, when you click generate code,
the equation used for calculating the budget in our javascript file will appear on the left and the corresponding value should appear on the right when you run the code. When you click 
the save code button, a js with the code will be downloaded
