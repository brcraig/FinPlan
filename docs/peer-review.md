The first peer review ensuring that the inputs couldn't be negative was very helpful, and we implemented it into our code.
Unfortunately, the second peer review, once merged with our code, did not work out and messed with our code. So, we had to restore the previous code to get it functional again.
Both ideas were really good, and we plan on keeping the first pull request as well as working on implementing the second suggestion in a way that fully merges with our original code.
